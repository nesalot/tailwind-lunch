## Basics of App:

Twitter Profile Card Component built purely in Tailwind CSS and Laravel. This was example project to show off the capabilities of Tailwind CSS for a 1 hour presentation I did at work to show off my fellow dev team on why our whole team should use Tailwind CSS.

1. First, clone the repo to your local machine:
